# ESP-Polar
This is a simple firmware code that connects ESP32 to a Polar OH1 band and reads heart rate. 
After reading heart rate it is temporarily stored in ESP32 before uploading via WiFi to Firebase. 
Another piece of code is used on Google Sheet to retrieve data from Firebase to enable easy retrival of Polar OH1 data.
